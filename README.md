## ✨ Overview

Deployment Doctor is an explainable incident detection platform that analyzes deployment logs and identifies root causes using deterministic rules, evidence attribution, and relationship analysis.

Unlike AI-based log analyzers, every result is:

* 🔍 Explainable
* 📌 Evidence-backed
* ♻️ Reproducible
* 🧾 Auditable

Detection logic never relies on AI.

AI is used only as an optional summary layer.

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

When deployments fail, engineers usually:

* Read thousands of log lines manually
* Search dashboards for clues
* Ask an LLM to guess the issue

Each approach has tradeoffs.

Deployment Doctor explores a different idea:

> Model operational knowledge as deterministic rules instead of probabilistic predictions.

The result is a system that can explain exactly why it reached a conclusion.

## 🚀 Example

### Input

```log
ERROR: ECONNREFUSED 10.0.0.5:5432
database connection failed
retrying database connection
CrashLoopBackOff
```

### Result

```json
{
  "primary_incident": "DB_CONNECTION_FAILURE",
  "confidence": 100,
  "status": "CONFIDENT"
}
```

### Why?

```text
Line 42:
ERROR: ECONNREFUSED 10.0.0.5:5432

Pattern:
ECONNREFUSED

Weight:
+40
```

Every score can be traced back to evidence.

## ✨ Features

### Detection Engine

* Deterministic incident detection
* Rule-based scoring
* Evidence attribution
* Root cause ranking
* Relationship-aware analysis
* DAG validation

### Platform

* REST API
* PostgreSQL persistence
* React dashboard
* Analysis history
* Sample log scenarios
* Optional AI summaries

---

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights

### Deterministic by Design

Same input produces the same output.

No prompts.
No randomness.
No model drift.

---

### Explainability First

Every finding references:

* Evidence line
* Matched pattern
* Score contribution

---

### Relationship-Aware Detection

Blueprints form a Directed Acyclic Graph.

```text
DNS_FAILURE
      ↓
DB_CONNECTION_FAILURE
      ↓
CRASH_LOOP_BACKOFF
```

The engine understands causal chains rather than isolated errors.

---

### JSONB Report Storage

Complete analysis reports are stored as JSONB documents while key fields remain indexed for filtering and analytics.
